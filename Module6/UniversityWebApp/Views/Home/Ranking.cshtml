<h1>How University Rankings Are Determined</h1>

<p>Ranking universities is a complex process that takes into account a variety of factors. Each ranking organization may weigh these factors differently, but the following are the most common criteria used to rank top universities:</p>

<h2>1. Academic Reputation (30%)</h2>
<p>The academic reputation is typically measured through global surveys among academics and researchers. These surveys gauge the perceived prestige of an institution and its faculty, as well as the impact of research output.</p>

<h2>2. Employer Reputation (20%)</h2>
<p>Employers from around the world are surveyed to determine which universities produce the best graduates. This criterion reflects the employability and preparedness of alumni entering the workforce.</p>

<h2>3. Faculty-to-Student Ratio (10%)</h2>
<p>This metric evaluates the availability of academic staff compared to the number of enrolled students. A lower ratio indicates smaller class sizes and more personalized education.</p>

<h2>4. Research Output and Citations per Faculty (20%)</h2>
<p>This criterion evaluates the volume and impact of research produced by the university. Highly cited papers and contributions to various academic fields are given significant weight. The research impact is often calculated using citation databases like Scopus and Web of Science.</p>

<h2>5. International Diversity (10%)</h2>
<p>This factor considers the number of international students and faculty members, reflecting the university's global appeal and cultural diversity.</p>

<h2>6. Infrastructure and Facilities (5%)</h2>
<p>This measures the quality of physical and academic resources, including libraries, laboratories, and campus facilities.</p>

<h2>7. Alumni Success and Impact (5%)</h2>
<p>This metric tracks the accomplishments of alumni in various fields, including Nobel laureates, industry leaders, and prominent professionals.</p>
